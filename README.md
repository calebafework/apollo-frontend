# Apollo

## What is Apollo
   Named after the Olympian God of music, Apollo takes an input and curates a playlist based off the mood of your input. To use Apollo simply write a brief paragraph about how you're feeling. Apollo will then analyze the tone of your paragraph and provide you with a Spotify playlist. From there, you will sign into your Spotify account to listen to the playlist.

## Frontend

## Unsolved Problems and future updates
   Future updates will include the Spotify API to dynamically create playlists. I would also love to use twitter API to take recent tweets as an input instead of using a form on the site.
